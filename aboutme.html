		<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
		<p>
		<pre>
				Hi my name is Myrtle V, I . I am a Junior at SAS (School for Advanced Studies) in Miami, Fl. 
			I enjoy watching Sci-Fi movies and drama TV shows.
			I love to participate in community and school activities. I really enjoy computer science, programming and engineering. 
			This summer I decided that I wanted to further my knowledge about these topics so I joined Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. 
			For 8 long weeks I, alongside 19 other girls, learned about the basics of computer science. 
			We started off on Scratch and then slowly moved on to PYTHON, PYGAME, C++ HTML, JavaScript,and CSS. 
			It was a terrific experience and completely changed my outlook on the world. 
			I am a huge math and science buff but I'm no braniac or child prodigy but I do work really hard and I love to learn new things. 
			This is just a portfolio of projects I have worked on whether they be about Computer Science or things I have done in my community.
